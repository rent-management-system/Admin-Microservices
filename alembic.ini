# The URL for the database. This is typically provided by the environment
# or a configuration file.
# For example:
# sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/database
# You should set this in your .env file or directly in the environment.
# For local development, you might set it here for convenience, but it's
# better to manage it via environment variables.
# sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database_name
